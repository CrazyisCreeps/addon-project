Junior Developer is the rank before [Developer](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/developer). 

#### Description

A Junior Developer is similar to Developer, but with less permsiions and access. Although they can be promoted to Developer, this isn't guaranteed to happen. Similar to a Developer, Jr Devs can either work on webiste or PGM developement, and tend to work on their own projects. You can review the revisions [here](https://stratus.network/revisions/plugins)

#### Requirements

An important requirement is to know programming and/or markup languages. Users have to apply for the role as a developer. It is a prerequisite to be familiar with Git and Maven before applying. Understanding the PGM codebase is a key when applying. When applying, one must write an application as if they were applying for a job.
